# CityGuesser.com

At PennApps XVII, a team of Master's students in the Urban Spatial Analytics and City Planning Departments at the University of Pennsylvania tackled their first hackathon!

# Purpose of the Web Application: 
To create a fun and interactive way for people to learn and think about the world from a different perspective. 

Our game, CityGuesser, allows the user to zoom in as much as much as the google api will allow, but restricts zooming out to no more than 20,000ft. We think this is an elegant way to visualize and appreciate cultural differences unique to cities around the world while, simultaneously, exposing the user to the elements that characterize the built environment of regions.

While the game seems hard at first, students (and adults) will quickly learn how to distinguish patterns of urban development around and, hopefully, find that our application is a fun and engaging way to experience our world.



Note: Works best on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
